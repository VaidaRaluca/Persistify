# ðŸ“¦ Java Product Management Application

## ðŸš€ Overview
This Java application processes a list of **perishable and nonperishable products** from a file, sorts them based on their expiry date, and filters nonperishable products with a price below **100.0**. The sorted and filtered products are then saved into separate output files.

## ðŸ“‚ Features
- **Reads product data** from `products.txt`
- **Sorts perishable products** by expiry date and saves them to `sorted_perishable_products.txt`
- **Filters nonperishable products** (price < 100.0) and saves them to `nonperishable_products_less_than_100.txt`
- **Error handling** for invalid data and file operations

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **File Handling (BufferedReader & BufferedWriter)**
- **OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance)**
- **Collections & Streams API**

## ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes
In developing this Java application, I gained a deeper understanding of **serialization** and **interfaces**. I learned how to implement serialization to save and load object states, ensuring **data persistence across sessions**.
